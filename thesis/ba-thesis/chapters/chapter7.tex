% motivation?
Unlike most written text or lab speech data, spontaneous speech is <chaotic> in form. Without drafting or editing, a sentence settle in form as each word is spoken. Errors and markers of disfluency like pauses and repetitions are ubiquitous in spontaneous speech data. Before a consensus is reached in how people transcribe and annotate speech, transcribers had to device their own markings/symbols to faithfully transcribe the utterances/conversational interactions. The disadvantages are clear, inconsistent use of symbols is an obstacle for the sharing of linguistic data, which is indispensable in Natural Language Processing.\\

\subsection{POS tags mappings}

\paragraph{\texttt{art}}
Articles are marked as \texttt{DET} in UD Treebanks with feature \texttt{PronType=Art}.\\
\paragraph{\texttt{preart}}
\texttt{preart} are contractions of prepositions and articles, for instance the Italian \emph{alla} is the contraction of \emph{a} and \emph{la}. In UD-style annotations, words like \emph{alla} are treated as multi-word tokens and a POS tag is given to each part of the token. However, CHAT consider them to be single words with forms of their own. To keep the alignment with \%mor tier, here \texttt{preart} is mapped to \texttt{DET} because the word functions as a determiner.\\ 

\paragraph{\texttt{vimp}}
Imperatives are tagged with \texttt{vimp} in \%mor tier. However, in UD, imperatives are tagged with \texttt{VERB}, which is the category for all finite verbforms. Information of gender, person, number, tense, aspect, mood and voice are all specified as features. Therefore \texttt{vimp}, as an example, is mapped to \texttt{VERB} with \texttt{MOOD=Imp}.\\

\paragraph{\texttt{vpfx}}
Preverb/verb particles are tagged with \texttt{vpfx}. Although they are particles, according to UD's definition <insert reference to UD website in sidenote>, they belong to \texttt{ADP}.\\

\subsection{GR-deprel mappings}

In CHILDES CHAT annotations, syntactic relations are represented using Grammatical Relations (GRs), first devised by \cite{Sagae2004}. Since GRs are dependency relations, they correspond to \texttt{deprel} in CoNLL-U annotations. However, CHILDES and UD uses not only different labels for the dependency relations, but also quite different parsing schemes such that sometimes a conversion from GR to deprel also introduces a change in the structure of the dependency tree.\\

Defining mappings between a GR and a UD deprel thus ranges from direct and one-to-one label translation to linguistic knowledge-based conditional decisions. This section provides explanations to the adaptations made and gives detailed examples for a selected few hard-to-decide cases.\\

Direct mappings are listed in the table below:
