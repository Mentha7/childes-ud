\chapter{CHILDES \emph{CHAT} and UD \emph{CoNLL-U}}
\label{Chapter2}

This chapter introduces the two annotation schemes of interest---\emph{CHAT} and \emph{CoNLL-U}---in detail and gives the reader an idea of what information is shared by both annotations and what information is exclusively relevant to only one of them. This will shed light on the implementation of \emph{chatconllu} which will be discussed in \Cref{Chapter3}.

\section{CHILDES CHAT Transcription System}

\subsection{Motivation}
The \emph{Codes for Human Analysis of Transcripts} (CHAT) transcription system is developed for the (\cite{Macwhinney2000})\emph{Child Language Data Exchange System} (CHILDES) project (\cite{Macwhinney2000}) to study child language acquisition.

As MacWhinney pointed out in the CHAT manual, collecting audio data for spontaneous conversational interactions is easy, one just have to turn on the recorder, however, processing the collected recordings and turning them into usable data for linguistic research is a demanding task (\cite{Macwhinney2000}). Transcribing the conversations is such an indispensable preprocessing step. Consistency treatment of raw data is critical to scientific research. Therefore, it is hard to imagine how difficult it was to do consistent transcription when there was no standard format, especially for child speech, which is usually more chaotic than average adult speech data. Thus CHAT is designed to accommodate the need for a standard transcription system of conversational speech. Moreover, CHAT transcripts can be analysed by TalkBank programs \sidenote{\url{https://talkbank.org/software/}} like \emph{Computerized Language Analysis} (commonly referred to as the CLAN Program), which facilitates the transcription, sharing and analysis of human conversational interactions.

\subsection{File Structure}
For a CHAT file to be well-formed, there are some basic structural requirements to comply with. The minimum standards are prescribed by \emph{minCHAT} (\cite{Macwhinney2000}).

% describe only relevant minCHAT structure
First of all, each CHAT file should have 2 major parts:\\
\begin{itemize}
	\item headers that stores metadata like language and participants
	\item utterances which are the actual sentences being said
\end{itemize}
Each sentence is represented by a single line beginning with an asterisk symbol \texttt{*}, this is also called the \emph{main line}. Additional information can be optionally added as dependent tiers. Annotations of morphological, syntactical, and phonological information or general remarks of the transcriber's
choice all go into separate dependent tiers of the main utterance. Dependent tiers are preceded by the \texttt{\%} symbol.
% describe mor and gra tiers
\subsubsection{Dependent Tiers}
Almost any type of information can be organised into separate dependent tiers and added to each utterance. The two most commonly seen tiers are \texttt{\%mor} and \texttt{\%gra} which can be generated automatically by the use of a series of CLAN programs---\emph{MOR}, \emph{POST}, \emph{POSTMORTEM} and \emph{MEGRASP}.

Since information in \texttt{\%mor} and \texttt{\%gra} should be kept with individual tokens in CoNLL-U files, they have to be processed in such a way that all relevant information from both tiers (if they are present) are associated with the respective token in the utterance.

\subsubsection{Morphosyntactic Coding with \emph{\%mor} Tier}
% token links %mor to the main line. one-to-one correspondence between
normalised utterance and %mor.
% structure of individual words
% structure of word groups  -> conllu: multi-word tokens

\subsubsection{Syntactic Dependency Analysis with \emph{\%gra} Tier}

\section{UD \emph{CoNLL-U} Annotation Scheme}

\section{Shared Information vs. Exclusive Information}
% token as the basic unit of CHAT and CoNLL-U annotations.
% token also links %mor and %gra to the main line. one-to-one correspondence
% between normalised utterance and %mor.
