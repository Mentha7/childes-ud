% What are the potential ways chatconllu can be used?
As a two-way converter, chatconllu can be used as an intermediate step to augment information to either annotation format. For instance, one can start with cha files, convert them to conllu files and pass those files to UDPipe for dependency parsing. After that, the files can either be exported as a preliminary speech treebank or converted back to CHAT format with added dependent tiers.
