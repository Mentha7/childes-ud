% intro
Traditionally, linguistic research has primarily been language-specific, with theories stem from studies on Indo-European languages. In recent decades, there has been much progress in crosslinguistic research, one of which is the \emph{universal dependencies} (UD) project (\cite{nivre2016} and \cite{nivre2020}).

As Joakim Nivre explained in his chapter \emph{Towards a Universal Grammar in Natural Language Processing}, instead of a descriptive and explanatory account of morphosyntax, UD's universal grammar is devised for natural language processing (\cite{nivre2015}). Backed by both universal and language-specific tagsets, UD's \emph{CoNLL-U} annotation allows for crosslinguistic corpus sharing. However, most UD treebanks are still based on written text.

Like CoNLL-U, \emph{CHAT} is a standardised annotation scheme. It is part of the \emph{Child Language Data Exchange System} (CHILDES) project (\cite{Macwhinney2000}), and it offers a standard way to transcribe spontaneous speech. Morphosyntactic information can also be added as dependent tiers to the main utterances, and if preferred, automatically by running \emph{MOR} (\cite{Macwhinney2000}), \emph{POST} (\cite{parisse2000}) and \emph{GRASP} (\cite{Sagae2004}).

It would be beneficial to use the advantages of both formalisms to compensate each other, CHILDES can provide UD with spontaneous speech treebanks, and UD can offer its tagsets which are widely accepted. To achieve this goal, a two-way converter, chatconllu, is is designed and implemented as a command-line tool in this project. There are also many tools developed to process CoNLL-U formatted files, with which additional information can be augmented to the CHAT files. chatconllu, as a format converter, strives to serve as an initial (and sometimes final) procesisng step in this pipeline.

% explain the choice of the 2 annotations first
This thesis aims to explore and experiment with format conversion between these two annotation schemes via implementing a two-way converter with Python. The scope of analysis is limited to a selected few corpora from the CHILDES database, shown in \Cref{tab:martabdb}. Transcriptions in CHAT format are first converted to CoNLL-U format and then converted back to see which information is lost in the process. To verify the conversion and back-conversion of files, both formats are validated using the tools provided by the two projects---CHILDES and UD.

This thesis also serves as a complement to the code on GitHub \sidenote{childes-ud/chatconllu: \url{https://github.com/Mentha7/childes-ud}}. \Cref{Chapter2} gives necessary background information of both annotation schemes. \Cref{Chapter3} introduces the converter and its implementation. \Cref{Chapter4} discusses the mappings from CHILDES to UD. \Cref{Chapter5} explains the validation process, discusses the current weaknesses and future improvements of chatconllu. Finally, with \Cref{Chapter6} I conclude this thesis and outlines related work.
