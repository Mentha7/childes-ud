% intro
Traditionally, linguisitc research has largely been language-specific, with theories stem from studies on Indo-European languages. In recent decades, there has been much progress in crosslinguistic research, one of which is the Universal Dependencies (UD) Project \cite{nivre2016}, \cite{nivre2020}. As Joakim Nivre explained in his chapter \emph{Towards a Universal Grammar in Natural Language Processing} , instead of a descriptive and explanatory account of morphosyntax, UD's universal grammar is devised for the purpose of natural language processing \cite{nivre2015}. Backed by both universal and language-specific tagsets, UD's CoNLL-U annotation is a scheme that allows for crosslinguistic corpus sharing. However, most UD treebanks are still based on written text.\\

Like CoNLL-U, CHAT (Codes for Human Analysis of Transcripts) \cite{Macwhinney2000} is a standardised annotation scheme. It is part of the CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System) Project \cite{Macwhinney2000}  and it offers a standard way to transcribe spontaneous speech. Morphosyntactic information can also be added as dependent tiers to the main utterances, and if preferred, automatically, by running MOR <citation, >, POST <citation,> and GRASP \cite{Sagae2004}.\\

It would be interesting to use the advantages of both formalisms to compensate each other. With the help of a converter, CHILDES can provide UD with spontaneous speech treebanks, and UD can offer its tagsets which are widely accepted. There are also a lot of tools developed to process CoNLL-U formatted files, with which information can be augmented to the CHAT files. It is based on this motivation that chatconllu is designed and implemented.\\

% explain the choice of the 2 annotations first
The focus of this thesis is to explore and experiment with format conversion between these two annotation schemes through designing and implementing a two-way converter with Python. The scope of analysis is limited to a selected few corpora from the CHILDES database. Transcriptions in \emph{CHAT} are first converted to \emph{CoNLL-U} and then converted back to see which information are lost in the process. Both formats are validated using the tools provided on their official websites.\\

This thesis serves as a complement to the code on GitHub <github repo,>. Section 2 gives necessary background information of both annotation schemes and outlines related work; section 3 introduces the converter and its implementation; section 4 discusses the mappings from CHILDES to UD; section 5 explains the validation process and discusses the current weaknesses and future improvements of chatconllu; finally, with section 6 I conclude this thesis.\\
