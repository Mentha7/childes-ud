% explain the choice of the 2 annotations first

The focus of this thesis is to explore and experiment with format conversion between these two annotation schemes through designing and implementing a two-way converter with Python. The scope of analysis is limited to a selected few corpora from the CHILDES database. Transcriptions in \emph{CHAT} are first converted to \emph{CoNLL-U} and then converted back to see which information are lost in the process.


% explain the choice of the 2 annotations, to be finished separately and integrated into the section above.
